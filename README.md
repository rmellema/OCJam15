This is my project for OCJam. 

It constists of multiple parts which all depend on each other.

*   *KNN*: A small library for doing K-Nearest Neighbour. It also has
    functions for calculating the euclidian distance between two points.

*   *IBL*: Intelligent Block Locator, uses `knn` for locating blocks of 
    interest in a set area around a geolyzer. It returns all the relative
    coordinates of the found blocks.
